Put 8-10 drops on the scalp and gently massage it into scalp and hairs, hair ends. Keep it 2-3 hours and wash hair wish natural shampoo. <\/p><p>We do not recommend putting hair oil on very oily, dirty hair and scalp, because it will reduce the ability of the hair oil to be absorbed into the scalp and will not improve blood circulation, which is necessary for hair growth stimulation.<\/p><p>We also do not recommend to keep hair oil longer than 8 hours, because it tends to collect dirt and leaves your hair with excess grime.<\/p><p>If your scalp has no sensitivity on essential oils or other ingredients, then you can leave hair oil for night and wash it in the next morning. But this method should not be used regularly as natural oils can clog the pores.<\/p><p>Regularity is very important to gain and see results.
